    <section>
      <p>VM-CHAOS (VMCb) is a community-built project where you can either upload virtual machine images or submit live connection details so that others can SSH or remote connect into them. Our goal is to provide a fun, experimental playground where chaos is allowedâ€”but please remember not to store anything important.</p>
      <p>This site is initially AI generated, and with help from collaborators, it will grow into a robust tool for creative and technical experiments.</p>
