      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>Welcome to VM-CHAOS (VMCb). By using this service you agree to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may do anything you want on the provided virtual machines—even delete every file—because the VMs are ephemeral.</li>
        <li>Do not store any important data on these VMs. Everything is temporary and subject to chaos.</li>
        <li>Submissions can be either VM image files or live connection information. Multiple users may connect to the same VM.</li>
        <li>The service is provided “as-is” with no warranties, and you accept full responsibility for your actions.</li>
        <li>This site is AI generated to start with, and will evolve through community collaboration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the service.</p>
